# House Price Prediction using Scikit-learn Linear Regression

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a simple machine learning model using **Linear Regression** to predict house prices. The dataset contains various features related to houses, and the goal is to predict the house price based on those features using **Scikit-learn**'s `LinearRegression` model.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project typically includes various attributes (features) about houses such as:

- Number of bedrooms
- Number of bathrooms
- Square footage of the house
- Lot size
- Year built
- Location
- And more...

You can use your own dataset or download a public dataset such as the **[Boston Housing Dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html#boston-dataset)** (deprecated) or similar ones from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib (optional, for plotting)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for interactive development)

### Install Required Libraries

You can install the necessary Python libraries using `pip`. Run the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-prediction.git
   cd house-price-prediction
   ```

2. **Prepare the dataset**: 
   - If you're using your own dataset, place it in the project folder and modify the code to load the dataset.
   - Example dataset can be in CSV format with the following columns:
     - `bedrooms`, `bathrooms`, `sqft_living`, `sqft_lot`, `price`, etc.

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook** or Python script to train and test the model.

   If using a Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook house_price_prediction.ipynb
   ```

   If using a Python script:

   ```bash
   python house_price_prediction.py
   ```

## Model Training

The Linear Regression model is trained on the dataset using **Scikit-learn**'s `LinearRegression` class.

### Key Steps:

1. **Loading the data**: Load the dataset using `pandas`.
   
2. **Preprocessing**: 
   - Handle missing values (if any).
   - Perform any necessary feature scaling (if needed).
   
3. **Splitting the data**: Split the dataset into training and testing sets using `train_test_split` from Scikit-learn.

4. **Training the model**: Train the Linear Regression model using the training data:

   ```python
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
   from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

   # Load your data into pandas DataFrame (e.g., df)
   X = df[['bedrooms', 'bathrooms', 'sqft_living']]  # Features
   y = df['price']  # Target variable

   # Split the data into training and testing sets
   X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

   # Create and train the model
   model = LinearRegression()
   model.fit(X_train, y_train)
   ```

5. **Making predictions**: Once trained, use the model to predict prices for the test set:

   ```python
   y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
   ```

6. **Evaluating the model**: Evaluate the performance using metrics like **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** or **R² Score**.

   ```python
   from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score

   mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
   r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)

   print(f'Mean Squared Error: {mse}')
   print(f'R² Score: {r2}')
   ```

## Results

- After training the Linear Regression model, the model’s performance is evaluated using the test dataset.
- Common evaluation metrics:
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: A measure of how well the model predicts the prices. Lower values are better.
  - **R² Score**: Represents how well the independent variables explain the variance in the target variable (house price). Values closer to 1 indicate a better fit.
  
The model's prediction accuracy can vary based on the dataset and the features used.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to build a basic house price prediction model using Linear Regression. Further improvements could be made by using more advanced models like Decision Trees, Random Forests, or using feature engineering techniques to improve the model’s accuracy.
